# Mini-SQL-Engine
Given a metadata file with relevant schema, an SQL Engine can be run for a subset of SQL queries.

* The query engine supports `Project`, `Aggregate`, `Distinct`, `Where`, `Group By` and `Order By` operations.
* The data in the tables should be integer.
* To execute open a terminal from the `src` folder and run `2020201057.sh <sql_query>`.
* If the query is valid, the result is output on the terminal window.
* The `metadata.txt` file is essential for laying out the schema of the tables.
